I am a dad, an artist, a writer, a librarian, 
a web coder, a casual gamer, and just the
right kind of neurotic that I can function 
as if naturally disciplined and organized.
	</p>
<p>
I worked in social work for several years after
college before discovering my career in public
libraries. After some years in a public facing
role working with all ages in various roles,
I began work in digital services, and soon 
moved into management and administration.

	</p>
<p>
WORK &amp; CAREER
I originally studied religion and psychology,
and spent several years doing inpatient and
outpatient social work. But since 2003, I have
been working in Public Libraries, first in a
public facing role, planning and running 
programs for children, teens, and adults. 
	</p>
<p>
In 2010, I was recruited for my library system's
Digital Library, providing support to staff and
patrons related to our digital services, as well
as creating custom web interfaces for internal
and public use. 
	</p>
<p>
In 2014, I began managing the Digital Library
before moving into a interim role as Senior
Library Manager for Digital Infrastructure, 
overseeing Library IT, Marketing &amp; Awareness,
and Library Information Services (responsible 
for the library system's web presence and the
Integrated Library System software).
