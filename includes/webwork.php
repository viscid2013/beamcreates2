		I create web interfaces using HTML/Responsive CSS with MySQL/PHP-PDO and Javascript/jQuery. I did much of my early coding work as a Digital Librarian with Wake County Public Libraries, before taking on a management and administration role overseeing the department whose work includes handling WCPL's web presence. I am in the process of working on personal projects to deepen and enhance my knowledge and skills in these areas.
