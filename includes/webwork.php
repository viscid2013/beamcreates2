		I create web interfaces using HTML/Responsive CSS with MySQL/PHP-PDO and Javascript/jQuery. I did much of my early coding work as a Digital Librarian with Wake County Public Libraries, before taking on a management and administration role overseeing the department whose work includes handling WCPL's web presence. I am in the process of working on personal projects to deepen and enhance my knowledge and skills in these areas.

		<p><a href="http://digwebcode.wakegov.com/src/SAP/suggest_form_hx.php?showSecretForm=yes">Suggest a Purchase System</a></p>
		<p>Suggest a Purchase was a system built to manage purchase recommendations from library patrons.</p>
		<p>The front end includes an entry form for the suggestions that uses the Google Books API to pull author and title information using the ISBN as well as an ODBC connection to the Intergrated Library System database to check whether or not the item is already owned by the libraries.</p>
		<p>On the staff side, the stored requests are displayed in a table for viewing and editing. When the status of an item is changed to indicate whether or not it will be purchased, a relevant email message is automatically sent to the requesting patrons.</p>
		<p>NOTE: We recently transitioned the Suggest a Purchase system to a module built into our vendor-provided online catalog. This does mean some loss of customization, but it creates a more unified experience and less maintenance work for me!</p>
