		<p>
		I originally studied religion and psychology,
		and spent several years doing inpatient and
		outpatient social work. But since 2003, I have
		been working in Public Libraries, first in a
		public facing role, planning and running 
		programs for children, teens, and adults. 
		</p>
		<p>
		In 2010, I was recruited for my library system's
		Digital Library, providing support to staff and
		patrons related to our digital services, as well
		as creating custom web interfaces for internal
		and public use. 
		</p>
		<p>
		In 2014, I began managing the Digital Library
		before moving into a interim role as Senior
		Library Manager for Digital Infrastructure, 
		overseeing Library IT, Marketing & Awareness,
		and Library Information Services (responsible 
		for the library system's web presence and the
		Integrated Library System software).
