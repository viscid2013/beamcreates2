	<h3>About Me (Ben McFadden)</h3>
	<div>
		<p>I am a dad, an artist, a writer, a librarian, 
		a web coder, a casual gamer, and just the
		right kind of neurotic that I can function 
		as if naturally disciplined and organized.

		<p>
		I worked in social work for several years after
		college before discovering my career in public
		libraries. After some years in a public facing
		role working with all ages in various roles,
		I began work in digital services, and soon 
		moved into management and administration.
